#1 Newton Second Law 
—> read and stored massa benda as m
—> read and stored percepatan benda as a
—> read and stored gaya as F equals to zero
—> set F equals to m times a
—> display (F) plus “N” (string)
Expected output of F : 1200 Newton

#2 Tahun Kabisat
—> read and stored tahun as year
--> check value :
	if year modulo by four equals to zero AND year modulo by hundred not equals to 0 then display “kabisat”

	else display “not kabisat”

#3 Laundry day
—> read and stored number of clothes as total to zero
—> read and stored machine as power equals to null 
—> check value:
       for one until twenty:
		total equals to total plus one
		if total equals to twenty then set power equals to ‘on’
			then display power
		else power equals to ‘off’
